# rulez
Hashcat Rules

### all_the.rulez
This rule set came from gathering every rule list that I could find, sorting, and removing duplicates

You will very likely get warnings when running this list with hc as there are some out-of-date rules that don't apply to the current release

All other rules load without issue so you can just ignore

### balanced.rulez
Compilation of the most common rules from various sources
